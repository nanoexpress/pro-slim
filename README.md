## TO-DO / Roadmap

This project was planned as base of other nanoexpress variants and seems failed
to become that base version, but still could be used as technically how to
re-create express.js like API as implemented functions are small and pure functions

## Why PRO Slim

- nanoexpress v1.x and express-ws compatible API interface
- Much more stable, error percent was decreased by 90%
- Much cleaner API and codebase, but **pluggable** with **defines** and [middlewares](https://github.com/nanoexpress/middlewares)
- A bit faster than PRO version
