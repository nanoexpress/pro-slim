## Deprecation note

This project now marked as **Deprecated** because of some of internet open-source projects copied from codebase (even with TypeScript typings) without reference back to project, no donation nor activate code contribution from community.
I love and respect open-source so i keep this project as open-source but without any future updates even bug-fixes. Any commits and updates (if ever will be) goes as private.
The reason of deprecation as i don't have enough time to support project, add features and i have bills to pay, no one pays that for me.

If you want better performance, look at [**uWebSockets.js**](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js) or _uWebSockets.js powered_ [**HyperExpress**](https://github.com/kartikk221/hyper-express) for Express.js compatibility

> There have been plans, see **TO-DO / Roadmap** section (below)

Special thanks as company sponsoring open-source:

- JetBrains (from 2019)
- MacStadium (from 2020)
- Paw (from 2020)
- BrowserStack (always from 2016)

as well as [Sergey NN](https://github.com/mrauhu) and
[Yaroslav Dobzhanskij](https://github.com/yarsky-tgz) as a Gold+ sponsors

I hope you understand me.

## TO-DO / Roadmap

This project was planned as base of other nanoexpress variants and seems failed
to become that base version, but still could be used as technically how to
re-create express.js like API as implemented functions are small and pure functions

## Why PRO Slim

- nanoexpress v1.x and express-ws compatible API interface
- Much more stable, error percent was decreased by 90%
- Much cleaner API and codebase, but **pluggable** with **defines** and [middlewares](https://github.com/nanoexpress/middlewares)
- A bit faster than PRO version
